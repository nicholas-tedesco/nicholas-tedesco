NOTE: this account is a work-in-progress; I actually have another account, but felt that it was a bit too messy to link at the moment. I'm in the process of updating this account to showcase some cool work / school / personal projects, but it's going to take me a few days (on top of work, school, etc.); having said this, I didn't want to wait this long to submit my job app!!
