- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @nicholas-tedesco
- ðŸ‘€ I have interests in machine learning / artificial intelligence, and work primarily in python
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently pursuing a master's in computer science from Georgia Tech

NOTE: this is a work-in-progress; I actually have another GitHub account, but felt that it was a bit too messy at the moment to link. I am in the process of updating this account, including implementing a GitHub pages website to showcase some of my personal projects. However, I did not want this to get in the way of submitting my job app ASAP!!
