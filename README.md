## 👋 Hi, I’m @nicholas-tedesco! 

- 🌱 I'm an aspiring software developer with interests in data science, machine learning, and full stack development. 
- 📚 In undergrad, I studied biochemistry with the intention of continuing on to medical school. However, I realized my passion for coding along the way!
  
I'm currently...
- 👨‍💼 working as a data scientist at Humana.
- 🏫 pursuing a master's degree in computer science from Georgia Tech.
- 🖥️ filling in the gaps with self-teaching and personal projects. 

In my free time, I enjoy... 
- 🏋🏻 exercising -> I was a member of Pitt's club powerlifting team. 
- 🎹 playing music -> I played the guitar growing up, picked up the drums in college, and have now fully switched over to piano. 
- ♟️ playing chess -> I started relatively late (22), but am gradually improving day by day. 

Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or reach out via email!
